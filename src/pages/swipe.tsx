        <hr />
        <p>
          Under the Federal Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Guide and Seeing Eye Dogs are covered
          by the term ?assistance animals?.
                        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While the Disability Discrimination Act includes a section on exemptions to access for
          assistance animals (Section 54A), it does not explicitly state the types of establishments
          where assistance animals are not permitted. As a result of precedents that have been
          established through case law, however, it is generally accepted that dog guides are not
          permitted in operating theatres, hospital burns units, commercial kitchens and some zoos.
                        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When it comes to medical facilities, even solicitors seem to have some confusion in regards
          to where assistance animals are and are not permitted. This being the case, we have had
          several members that have been granted access to intensive care units with their dog guides,
          so this precedent has already been established.
